# Ruby Practice Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Ruby practice exercises that I have completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Full Stack Ruby on Rails curriculum. The exercises are designed to help me strengthen my Ruby programming skills and gain hands-on experience in solving various coding challenges.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the exercises and experiment with different inputs to test the code by clicking the links below. The repl.it environment provides an easy and convenient way to run Ruby code without the need for local setup.

## Exercises

The exercises in this repository cover a wide range of Ruby programming concepts and techniques. Each exercise is organized in a separate file and includes a problem statement or prompt along with my implementation.

To run each exercise, simply click on the repl.it link provided below:

- [Caesar Cipher](https://replit.com/@Petahs/caesar-cipher#main.rb)
- [Substrings](https://replit.com/@Petahs/substrings#main.rb)
- [Stock picker](https://replit.com/@Petahs/stock-picker#main.rb)
- [Bubble Sort](https://replit.com/@Petahs/bubble-sort#main.rb)

Clicking on the repl.it link will open the exercise in a ready-to-run Ruby environment on repl.it. You can then modify the code or add inputs to test different scenarios. Once you're ready, click the "Run" button to execute the code and see the output.

## Installation
If you want to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites
